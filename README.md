## :question: Get Help

For bug reports and feature requests, open issues. :bug:

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications _for free_! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

-   Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
- **Crypto.&#65279;com** Use my referral link https://crypto.com/app/f2smbah8fm to sign up for Crypto.&#65279;com and we both get $25 USD :) 
-   [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations] **PayPal**— You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
-   [![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/T6T412CXA) **Ko-fi**— I'll buy a ~~tea~~ coffee. :coffee: :wink:
- <img src="./examples/bitcoin.png" width="100"/>&nbsp; **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code): `3GqiebqcZeonziRUMYxU35J3jPSMJzpTAc`

Thanks! :heart:
